# Uber_Lyft-Data-Analysis-Project

Uber and Lyft both adopted a model known as a customer-to-customer (C2C) model by utilizing technology. It is a great alternative to traditional taxi services that offer door-to-door convenience, safety, and reliable quality. Both companies are based in San Francisco but could vary in terms of price, time, culture, and offering different options. In this project, we will analyze and visualize data comparing Uber and Lyft ridesharing services in Boston, MA to identify similarities and differences.
